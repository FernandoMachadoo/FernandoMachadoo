- 👋 Hi, I’m @FernandoMachadoo
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things in the programming area, where many of my friends showed me what the IT area was, leaving me intrigued with what could be achieved with these studies, as I am keen on playing videogames and working on computers and eletronic things since I was a child.
- 🌱 I've already learned HTML and CSS, but I’m currently learning  Java, JavaScript, PHP7, MYSQL Database and SASS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in places that put me to provewhat are my knowledges in the area, and so, I can teach my self and learn every day more ways to do what I like.
- 📫 How to reach me? through my email igino.machado@gmail.com.
